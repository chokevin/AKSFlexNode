// CheckRouteOverlap returns a task that installs a oneshot systemd unit which,
// before the nspawn machine starts, verifies that expected IPv4 CIDRs all route
// via the IPv4 default outbound interface.
//
// The classic failure it catches is the Azure ND-isr H200 IB driver shadowing a
// customer VNet CIDR with a connected /16 on ib0 — in that case
// `ip -4 route get <cluster-cidr-probe>` returns ib0 instead of eth0, traffic
// blackholes, and kubelet looks healthy while pods can't reach the API server.
//
// Pair with ConfigureStaticRoutes (which fixes the overlap) for full coverage:
// the static-routes unit is ordered Before this one, so by the time the check
// runs the kernel route table reflects any mitigations.
//
// Mode "STRICT" (recommended for production): any overlap causes the unit to
// exit 1. With RequiredBy=systemd-nspawn@.service the nspawn machine will not
// start until the overlap is resolved. Mode "WARN" (default): the overlap is
// logged and written to /run/aks-flex-node/route-overlap.detected but the
// machine still starts.
